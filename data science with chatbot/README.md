                                **Water Quality Prediction: A Data Science Project Using CRISP-DM**


Project Overview:
This project aims to use chatgpt to create a data science project (water quality prediction) using CRISP-DM Methodology.



Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to create a predictive model that determines if water is suitable for consumption. This involves analyzing different chemical and physical characteristics of water and using machine learning to classify each sample as potable (1) or not potable (0).



CRISP-DM Methodology:
The project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, which includes:

Business Understanding: Defining the objective of predicting water quality to enhance public health.
Data Understanding: Exploring the dataset, including features such as pH, hardness, total dissolved solids, and others.
Data Preparation: Handling missing values, anomalies, and standardizing the dataset for model training.
Modeling: Building and evaluating different machine learning models, including RandomForest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Deployment: Preparing the model for real-world use through testing and evaluation.




Dataset Description:
The dataset contains 3276 water samples, each with a set of features that represent different quality metrics:

pH: Indicates the acidity or basicity of water.
Hardness: Represents the concentration of calcium and magnesium.
Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): Indicates the amount of dissolved minerals.
Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic Carbon, Trihalomethanes, and Turbidity are other features that help determine water quality.
The target variable is Potability, which indicates whether the water is suitable for drinking.



Key Phases of the Project:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handled missing values using the median to ensure data robustness.
Standardized features to ensure consistency across all metrics.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized feature distributions and correlations to understand the dataset.
Determined that Solids, Organic Carbon, and Chloramines were among the most influential features for potability.
3. Modeling
Built and compared multiple machine learning models:
RandomForest Classifier emerged as the best model with an accuracy of 70.12%.
Logistic Regression and Decision Tree were also tested but did not perform as well.
4. Evaluation and Results
The RandomForest Classifier was selected as the best-performing model based on its balanced accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Final evaluation metrics showed the effectiveness of the model in predicting non-potable water with potential areas for improving recall for potable samples.
5. Sample Prediction
The model was used to predict the potability of a randomly selected sample, providing practical insights into its use in real-world scenarios.
Key Findings
Features like Solids, Organic Carbon, and Chloramines play a critical role in predicting water quality.
The RandomForest Classifier provided the best balance between accuracy and recall, making it suitable for predicting water potability.
