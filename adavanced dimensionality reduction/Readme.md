# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

This repository contains an extensive demonstration of various dimensionality reduction techniques. The project is divided into three main sections:

## Sections

### 1. General Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
This section covers:
- **Randomized PCA**
- **Kernel PCA**
- **Incremental PCA**
- **Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)**
- **t-SNE**
- **UMAP**
- **ISOMAP**
- **MDS**
- **Factor Analysis**
- **Autoencoders**


#### Key Features:
- Each technique is applied to a suitable dataset.
- Visualizations for 2D projections are provided.

### 2. Advanced Interactive Visualizations
Interactive visualizations for:
- **UMAP**: Preserving global and local structures.
- **t-SNE**: Visualizing clusters with reduced dimensions.

#### Tools Used:
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive scatter plots.
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: For static visualizations.

### 3. Dimensionality Reduction on Databricks
This section demonstrates:
- **UMAP** and **t-SNE** on large datasets.
- Leveraging Databricks for scalable and distributed processing.
